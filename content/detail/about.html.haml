  Hi,

  'verticonaut' is a phantasy name. It's a combination of 'vertical' and 'astronaut'. As a kid I wanted to become an astronaut. Well - that's pretty hard to achieve. To get off the ground I started rock climbing. Thats the 'vertical' part of the name. So - the combination is these words is obvious and fits into the alrrady existing names like 'astronaut', 'kosmonaut', 'taikonaut'

  I like the Ruby programming language. Once having programmed in Smalltalk, this language was always my reference as well in the times of Java. There was (still is) the elegent Smalltalk WebFramework 
  %a(href="http://seaside.st" target="_blank") Seaside.
  Not far away -
  %a(href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank") Ruby on Rails
  seemed very interesting to me.
  And here I am - I got the chance to work with this tools - and more importat - with the inspiring people that build the community around this language and framework.
