  Hi,
  %br
  my name is Martin Schweizer. I live in Luzern in Switzerland. I'm interested in Web development, rock climbing and photography.

  'verticonaut' is a phantasy name. It's a combination of 'vertical' and 'astronaut'. As a kid I wanted to become an astronaut. Well - that's pretty hard to achieve. To get off the ground I started rock climbing. Thats the 'vertical' part of the name. So - the combination is these words is obvious and fits into the alrrady existing names like 'astronaut', 'kosmonaut', 'taikonaut'.

  I like the Ruby programming language. Once having programmed in Smalltalk, this language was always my reference as well in the times of Java. Onc I stumbled upon the elegant Smalltalk WebFramework 
  %a(href="http://seaside.st" target="_blank") Seaside
  = ". Not far away -"
  %a(href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank") Ruby on Rails
  seemed very interesting to me as well.
  And here I am - I got the chance to work with this technology - and more importat - with the inspiring people that build the community around this language and framework.
